## My first post

Hi! So... this is how the blog is gonna work:
    (1) I will try to post monthly on a book chapter, probably on functional analysis or measure theory, in the beginning.
    (2) In that post, I will have a PDF so anyone can access my notes and use them as complements or so. 
    (3) The goal is to keep both, a database and a public access. 

(*) In my posts, I will say which book was used because sometimes I might refer to the numbering used in theorems or definitions.
